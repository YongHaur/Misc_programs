I wrote this small program in Scala in which it calculates the Huffman coding of the each of the given character (or input).  Huffman coding is a very interesting algorithm to compress data.  For the more details of Huffman coding, there is plenty of the resources in the Internet:

In a scala interpreter, type: 

huffman1(List(("a", 90), ("b", 35), ("c", 67), ("d", 2), ("e", 13), ("f", 20), ("g", 39)))

we will see:

List((g,00), (c,01), (b,100), (d,10100), (e,10101), (f,1011), (a,11))

which is the list of the calculated Huffman codings for each of the input character (with its weighted as denoted by integer)
