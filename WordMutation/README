This program calculates all the ways to transform a string from one to another by mutating only one character at each time.  Also, each intermediate mutation must be a valid string inside an English dictionary.  For example, to mutate a string "boy" to "eat", there are two ways:

Way 1)
	boy 
	bay 
	bat
	eat
	
Or 

Way 2)
	boy
	bot
	bat
	eat

The goal of the program is to find such all possible ways.

To run the program, download the WordMutation-v{$version}.jar file and issue this command :   
java -cp WordMutation-v1.0.jar RunMain
