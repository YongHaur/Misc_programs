Braces tell the bash shell to generate what's called the "Cartesian product" of the given set, where elements of the set are comma-separated. The problem at hand is to implement this feature of bash, i.e. produce the same output as bash does for a given input string.

For example:
$ echo a{b,c}d{e,f,g}hi
abdehi abdfhi abdghi acdehi acdfhi acdghi
$ echo a{b,c{d,e,f}g,h}ij{k,l}
abijk abijl acdgijk acdgijl acegijk acegijl acfgijk acfgijl ahijk ahijl

In your response, please send:
(1) Your solution, written in Java, Scala, Python, Ruby, Go, or JavaScript
(2) Instructions on how to run the code
(3) Any unit tests that you wrote to demonstrate the correctness of your solution
